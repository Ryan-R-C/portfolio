                    <p>HTML can vinculate with CSS and JavaScript, and make them vinculate with themselves. To, for exemple, has a unique design of a column, like the last one, it needs to have a id or class.<br>Difference: id &rarr; one single element <br>class &rarr; two or more elements.

                     <p>It is the beauty of the website: columns, colors and typography. It is delimited by the tag <span>&lt;style&gt;</span></p>
                     <p>The style of this column was made by the selector: <span>display: flex;</span>. The colors by <span>color: #000000</span>. And the typography imported by Google Fonts, which is Open Sans</p>
                     <p>You can play a lot with CSS, it is possible to do animations by itself, but is not recomended, to do arts, in a limited way and that is why comes our next topic, just in time.</p></div>
