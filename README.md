# Portfolio

## My Portfolio and online Resume

It was made using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. The reason is I want to show what I can do using just the basic tools of Web Dev.

In this project I did:
  - Language Switcher with 4 languages;
  - Translate the menu when the Header icon's is clicked;
  - Unfade Up animation in the text, when the screen of the client is over the text
  - Dynamic sections using flex-box
  - Web accessibility
  - SEO techniques
